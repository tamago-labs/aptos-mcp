# Aptos MCP

![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@tamago-labs/aptos-mcp)

**Aptos MCP** is a comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation for the Aptos blockchain, compatible with MCP clients like Claude Desktop or Cursor.ai. It provides a complete DeFi toolkit covering major Aptos protocols including lending, DEX operations, liquid staking, and smart contract development through the Aptos CLI.

## Features

- **25+ MCP tools** covering the complete Aptos DeFi ecosystem
- **Complete DEX integration** - Liquidswap with swapping, liquidity management, and pool creation
- **Professional lending protocols** - Joule Finance with full lending/borrowing workflow
- **Liquid staking options** - Thala Finance and Amnis Finance integrations
- **Stablecoin operations** - MOD minting and redemption through Thala
- **Native APT staking** with validator insights from AI 

## Using with Claude Desktop

1. Install Claude Desktop if you haven't already
2. Open Claude Desktop settings
3. Add the Aptos MCP client to your configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aptos-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@tamago-labs/aptos-mcp",
        "--aptos_private_key=YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY", 
        "--aptos_network=mainnet"
      ],
      "disabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

This Private Key mode is recommended for advanced users who can securely manage their private keys. The MCP client handles transactions locally without exposing any data to external servers.

## Troubleshooting

If you're using Ubuntu or another Linux environment with NVM, you'll need to manually configure the path. Follow these steps:

1. Install the Aptos MCP under your current NVM-managed Node.js version.

```bash
npm install -g @tamago-labs/aptos-mcp
```

2. Due to how NVM installs libraries, you may need to use absolute paths in your config. Replace the example values below with your actual username and Node version:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aptos-mcp": {
      "command": "/home/YOUR_NAME/.nvm/versions/node/YOUR_NODE_VERSION/bin/node",
      "args": [
        "/home/YOUR_NAME/.nvm/versions/node/YOUR_NODE_VERSION/bin/@tamago-labs/aptos-mcp",
        "--aptos_private_key=YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY",
        "--aptos_network=mainnet"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

3. Restart Claude Desktop and it should work now.

## Work with Local Files

When working with local files especially when using Aptos CLI tools for smart contract development to create, build, and test a Move package on your machineâ€”you'll need to import an additional MCP server library of `filesystem` made by Claude team. Use with:

```json
"filesystem": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": [
    "-y",
    "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
    "${workspaceFolder}"
  ],
  "disabled": false
}
```

`workspaceFolder` refers to your working directory. You can provide more than one argument. Subfolders or specific files can then be referenced in your AI prompt.

If you're using Linux and encounter issues during setup, please refer to the troubleshooting section.
